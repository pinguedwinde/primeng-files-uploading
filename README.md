# PrimeNgFilesUploading

PrimeNG is a rich set of open source native Angular UI components.

We use it this library to build an angular app for uploading files. We use also Express as a server.

- **PrimeNG**
- **Express**
- **CORS**
- **Multer** is a node.js middleware for handling **`multipart/form-data`**
- **Angular Animations**
- **HttpClientModule : HttpRequest, HttpEvent, HttpEventType**
- **Web native API Drag and Drop**

## Download

**PrimeNG** is available at npm, if you have an existing application run the following command to download it to your project.

**PrimeFlex** is a CSS utility library featuring various helpers such as a grid system, flexbox, spacing, elevation and more. Although it is not required, it is highly recommended to add PrimeFlex as it is likely to need such utilities when developing applications with PrimeNG. The version 3 is used here, and it's different from the version 2.

```sh
$ npm install primeng --save
$ npm install primeicons --save
$ npm install primeflex --save
```

For the Server

```sh
$ npm install express --save
$ npm install cors --save
npm install --save multer
```
